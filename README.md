# Update Github repositories license copyright year

## This is just an exercise, not considered totally reliable

### I wanted to update the license files of all my Github repositories
 
#### What it does

Works with any license which has one of the following types of copyright lines:

* Copyright (c) 2014-2015 Andrei Avram
* Copyright (c) 2016 Andrei Avram

It will just update/add the current year (or any you wish) for the copyright line.
If the year is 2017, the above two lines will be changed to:

* Copyright (c) 2014-2017 Andrei Avram
* Copyright (c) 2016-2017 Andrei Avram

#### Usage
    
* go run !(*_test).go

* Possible actions
    * List repositories: Only the username is needed
    * Update license: Username and access token needed
